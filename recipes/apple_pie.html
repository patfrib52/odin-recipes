    <h3>Apple Pie</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. </p>
    <p>It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. </p>
    <p>I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well! Serve hot or cold at family dinners or during the holidays, </p>
    <p>topped with whipped cream or ice cream,</p> 
    <p>or alongside a slice of Cheddar cheese.</p>
